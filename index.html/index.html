	<h2 id="background">Background Of Palestine</h2>
	<p id="graph">
		The word Palestine derives from ancient Greek (Philistia), but ancient Egyptian, Assyrian and Hebrew languages also included similar-sounding words to describe the region or its people. Judaism, Christianity and Islam are all strongly tied to the region, and trace origins to the land over the past few thousand years.

Following the 1918 fall of the <b>Ottoman Empire</b> during World War I, Palestine typically referred to the region between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River. Much of this land is now part of present-day Israel.

Today, the region known as the Palestinian Territories includes the<mark> West Bank</mark> (a territory that sits between modern-day Israel and Jordan) and the Gaza Strip (bordering Israel and Egypt). These areas have been under Israeli military occupation since 1967. However, control over this region is a complex and evolving situation. There is no international consensus concerning the <i>borders—28</i> United Nations member countries currently do not recognize Israel at all—and many areas claimed by the Palestinian Territories are also claimed by Israel.

		<h2 id="good">The partition of Palestine</h2>
		<p id="graph">
In 1947, after more than two decades of British rule, the United Nations proposed a plan to partition Palestine into two sections: an independent Jewish state and an independent Arab state. <i>The city of Jerusalem, which was claimed as a capital by both Jews and Palestinian Arabs, was to be an international territory with a special status.</i> 

Most Jewish leaders accepted the plan, but many Palestinian Arabs—some of whom had been actively fighting British and Jewish interests in the region since the 1920s—vehemently opposed it.

Some Arab leaders argued that they represented the majority of the population and should be granted more territory. They began to form volunteer armies throughout Palestine		</p>

	<section>
		<h2 id="good">Israel Becomes a state</h2>
		<p id="graph">
			In May 1948, less than a year after the Partition Plan for Palestine was introduced, Britain withdrew from Palestine and Israel declared itself an independent state, implying a willingness to implement the Partition Plan. 

Almost immediately, neighboring Arab armies moved in to prevent the establishment of the Israeli state. The 1948 Arab-Israeli War that ensued involved Israel and five Arab nations—Transjordan (now Jordan), Iraq, Syria, Egypt and Lebanon. By the war's end in July 1949, Israel controlled more than two-thirds of the former British Mandate, while Jordan took control of the West Bank and Egypt took control of the Gaza Strip.

The 1948 conflict opened a new chapter in the struggle between Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs, which now became a regional contest involving nation-states and a tangle of diplomatic, political and economic interests.

		<p style="border: 1px solid lightblue; padding: 10px;" >Since Hamas led an attack on southern Israel on October 7, in which 1,139 people were killed and 250 were taken captive, Israel has consistently bombarded Gaza. Israel claims its objective is to “dismantle Hamas” despite scepticism from experts, allies, and members of Israel's administration about its feasibility.</p>

			<h2 id="effect">Effects of Abuses</h2>
			<p id="graph">
				
				<b>The war in Palestine and Israel has destroyed and imperiled the lives and the mental and physical health of Palestinians, Israelis, and others in the region.</b> We express deep compassion for all those who are suffering as well as alarm for the future psychological and behavioral consequences that will affect the people caught in this conflict. The magnitude of death, destruction, and violence threatens to destabilize the region and has sent shock waves around the world, affecting many of us in our own communities.<br>

<i id="para"><mark>Recognizing the potential for tensions abroad to affect relationships among healthcare professionals in the United States and internationally, we urge professional societies to be true to their healing missions and support their members by opposing stigmatization of professionals based on their personal opinions or heritage.</mark></i>
<br>
The people of Palestine and Israel are suffering from war injuries and death. Tens of thousands of Gazans have died from lack of access to food, water, and healthcare. Israelis bear the anguish of having loved ones killed or held hostage. War traumas shake the foundation of a child’s current and future emotional, psychological, and cognitive development with implications for their self-concept and relationships with others. The effects of this war will undoubtedly be felt for generations.<br> <mark>All sides in this conflict desperately need safety, freedom from violence, and restoration of all components of civil society that will enable them to repair their lives and forge a brighter future.</mark>
<br>

We call upon mental health professionals to do all that they can to bring an end to this war as soon as possible and to support, through volunteerism, activism, leadership, and education, the recovery of war survivors and the healing of those with secondary trauma acquired while doing relief work in Gaza, Palestine, and Israel.

Forging a sustainable, equitable peace, and rebuilding what has been destroyed are daunting challenges. Mental health professionals can contribute their expertise regarding best practices in caring for those who have been displaced, injured, or traumatized. We can also help people deal with challenging emotions that are naturally aroused and inflamed by war, but that must be adaptively channeled for people to make peace, and eventually cooperate in the rebuilding and healing that must be done for all. Psychiatrists can also offer insights and relatedness to understand and contain suffering, while amplifying shared humanity and the possibilities of peace, healing, and cultural repair.

This crisis underscores the pressing needs of our interdependent world. We must move from anguish and conflict to deeper understanding, compassion, and goodwill.

			<h2 id="resources">Resources of war between Palestine and Israel</h2>
			<p id="graph">
				<h3 id="normal">Teeeitory and Land</h3>
				<h4 id="small">Disputed Territories:</h4>
				The conflict primarily revolves around land, specifically the territories of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem. Both Israelis and Palestinians claim historical and religious connections to these areas, leading to disputes over ownership and control.
				
				<h3 id="normal">Water Resources</h3>
				<h4 id="small">Access to Water:</h4>
				Water scarcity is a significant issue in the region, and access to water resources, such as the Jordan River and underground aquifers, is a point of contention. Both Israelis and Palestinians require access to these resources for agriculture, 
				industry, and domestic use.

               <h3 id="normal">Military and Security:

</h3>
<h4 id="small">Military Capabilities:</h4>
        Both Israel and Palestinian groups (such as Hamas in Gaza) maintain armed forces and security measures. Israel, as a state, has a sophisticated military with advanced weaponry, while Palestinian groups often rely on guerrilla tactics and asymmetric warfare.

<h3 id="normal">International Support and Diplomacy:</h3>

<h4 id="small">International Relations:</h4>

Both sides seek diplomatic and political support from various countries and international organizations. Israel historically receives strong support from the United States and other Western countries, while Palestinians receive support from Arab nations and some non-aligned states.


<h3 id="normal">Humanitarian Aid and Economic Support:

</h3>

<h4 id="small">Humanitarian Assistance:</h4>
 The conflict has led to humanitarian crises, particularly in Gaza, where economic conditions are dire due to blockades and restrictions on movement. Humanitarian aid from international organizations is crucial for alleviating suffering and supporting basic needs.

 <h3 id="normal">Media and Information Warfare:

</h3>
<h4 id="small">Propaganda and Information:</h4>
Both sides engage in media and information campaigns to influence public opinion and international perception of the conflict. This includes social media, traditional media outlets, and advocacy groups

<h3 id="normal">Religious and Cultural Resources:</h3>
<h4 id="small">Religious Sites:</h4>

The region is home to significant religious sites sacred to Jews, Muslims, and Christians. Disputes over access and control of these sites, such as the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem, often inflame tensions and spark violence.



<h3 id="normal">Political and Governance Structures:</h3>
<h4 id="small">Government and Governance:</h4>

Israel is a sovereign state with a democratically elected government. The Palestinian territories are governed by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza, each with its own political challenges and aspirations.

<h3 id="normal">Historical Narratives and Identity:</h3>
<h4 id="small">Narratives and Identity:</h4>
Historical narratives and collective identities play a crucial role in shaping perceptions and attitudes towards the conflict. Both Israelis and Palestinians have deep-seated historical grievances and claims to the land.


<h3 id="normal">External Influences and Interests:

</h3>
<h4 id="small">Regional Dynamics:</h4>

 The broader Middle East region, including neighboring countries like Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon, as well as regional powers like Iran and Saudi Arabia, also play roles in the conflict, sometimes exacerbating tensions or seeking to mediate.

 <h3 id="normal">Conclusion</h3>
 Understanding these various resources helps to contextualize the complexity and longevity of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Resolving the conflict involves addressing these multiple dimensions, including territorial disputes, resource management, security concerns, political aspirations, and humanitarian needs.
